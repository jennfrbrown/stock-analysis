Module 2 VBA

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to refactor the Module 2 solution code by switching the nesting order of the "for" loops.  We would then determine if the VBA script ran faster due to the nesting order of the "for" loop change.

### Background
During Module 2 we built a workbook that analyzed a dataset that focused specifically on green energy stocks (for the years 2017 and 2018) to determine their Yearly Return Percentage and Total Daily Volumes.  Within the green energy stock category, our client  was particularly looking at DAQO stocks (Ticker: DQ).  The analysis helped determine if DQ's performance over the years compared to other green energy stocks made them a good investment.  

Our client now want to expand the data set to include the entire stock market over the last few years.  Refactoring the code was important as the original workbook was originally coded to analyze only a dozen or so stocks, not thousands.  To perform this ananalysis, I used Microsoft Visual Basic (VBA) incorporating conditional formatting, loops, and conditional statements.  As the purpose of this project focuses on refactoring code, the results will highlight the differences between the two coding orders and format.

## Results
Each table below shows the Ticker Name, Total Daily Volume, and Percentage Return for that specific year.
