Module 2 VBA

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to refactor the Module 2 solution code by switching the nesting order of the "for" loops.  We would then determine if the VBA script ran faster due to the nesting order of the "for" loop change.

During Module 2 we built a workbook that analyzed a dataset to include the entire stock mare
